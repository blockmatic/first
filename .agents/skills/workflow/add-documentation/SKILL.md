Add documentation for the current code/feature. Follow `.cursor/rules/base/docs.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/base/readme.mdc`.

## Where to write

| Layer | Role | Update when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/web/content/docs/` MDX | How to work in this repo | Behavior, commands, or conventions changed |
| `.cursor/rules` | Short constraints | A convention the agent must not violate changed |
| Nearest README | How to run this app/package; links only | Scripts, setup, or package purpose changed |

Inline comments only when the code is otherwise misleading. Do not copy MDX into rules or READMEs. Do not `@`-attach MDX.

1. **Identify the topic**: Matching docs section, then existing topic page (create a page only if none fits)
2. **Write or patch MDX** if the canonical explanation changed
3. **Patch README** only for run/setup/scripts; link the MDX
4. **Patch the glob-matched `.mdc`** only if a constraint changed
